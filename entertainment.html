            <h2>Former supermodel Kate Moss has finally melted into a waxy puddle</h2><br>
               <h4> Author Waterford Whisper News March 9th 2017</h4></article>
            
            <section class="kate">
            <p>While many people knew this day was coming sooner rather than later, former supermodel Kate Moss has finally melted into a waxy puddle after becoming too old, WWN can confirm.</p>
                <p>Attending a lavish Vogue magazine covering the launch of a new Snapchat selfie by Kylie Jenner, Moss had complained of feeling &#8216;warm&#8217; only to slowly melt before everyone&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cindi Crawford last week, now Kate, who&#8217;s next? If only we could take them behind a shed when they hit 25 and shoot them, but this isn&#8217;t Hollywood, this is fashion, we have a conscience,&#8221; shared Anna Wintour, visibly upset by the sight of a once beautiful woman reduced to an amorphous puddle.</p>
<p>There was a silver lining for Moss as people at the party conceded that the British woman &#8216;completely owned&#8217; the waxy puddle look. However, not everyone was sympathetic about the tragedy that had befallen the model.</p>
<p>&#8220;She knew the deal when she started and frankly we all do. She was lucky they let her carry on past 21 if you ask me,&#8221; shared Bebop Jasmine Sky, the 13-year-old, 1/64th Cherokee Victoria Secrets lingerie model.</p>
<p>Moss was unable to comment on her new form as her mouth, eyes and other prominent features had melted, replaced by a nondescript shape which will soon harden.</p>
 <p>Negotiators have already offered Bosco a commissioning job at the station if the hostages are released, to which Bosco refused, shouting: “Typical RTE answer to an RTE problem; just move the fuckers around if you can’t fire them”.</p>
