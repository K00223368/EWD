            <section class="staff">
			<p>Staff at LIT are looking forward to Rag Week. They have all their alcohol bought for the week beginning the 13th of February. They plan on partying hard to relieve the stress of teaching unmannered students.</p>
            
            <p>The staff of Limerick Institute technology ran riot on Friday the 10th of February as the clock reached 5. It was like a scene out of saved by the bell. All lecturers came bursting through the main door roaring freedom.</p> 
            
            <p>LIT Staff filled the streets as their Rag Week celebrations got underway and a number of people were arrested at around 2.30am this morning. Videos uploaded on YouTube this morning show large crowds gathered outside fast food restaurants in the early hours of the morning.</p> 

           <p>They danced and sang the night away on O'Connell Street in Limerick City. Bus loads of lectures from the University of Limerick joined them in their celebrations.</p>
