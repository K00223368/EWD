            <h2>FOOTBALL BELIEVE BARCELONA ARE AMAZING</h2> <h4> Author Waterford Whisper News March 8th 2017</h4> </article>
 
            <section class="barcelona">
<p>After taking a break from pinching one another to ensure Barcelona&#8217;s incomparable 6-1 comeback really happened, football fans allowed themselves to enjoy and appreciate one of the greatest footballing spectacles ever witnessed.</p>
<p>The match was not without its negative fallout as shortly after the fulltime whistle, PSG&#8217;s entire squad retired from the game citing a chronic and debilitating case of embarrassment. Many of the players involved hoped that last night&#8217;s game would not become a cruel shorthand for people to use when describing how someone monumentally messed up or choked.</p>
<p>However, with the news that a man who walked in on his wife having sex with 12 of his best friends, shortly before he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and kidnapped by ISIS stated &#8220;well, at least I&#8217;m not a PSG player&#8221;, the likelihood of the French club being spared from being the butt of jokes for years to come look unlikely.</p>
<p>While the majority of Barcelona fans are still celebrating, some took a moment to acknowledge that it would be better on their nerves if their team did not go down 4-0 in the next round of the competition.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Liverpool fans are set to spend every waking moment on football forums stating that their team&#8217;s 2005 Champions League final comeback against AC Milan was actually better.</p>
            <p>Football fans have reached the unanimous conclusion that the world&#8217;s most widely played sport can be &#8216;pretty fucking amazing sometimes&#8217; after watching the stunning events of last night&#8217;s Champions League clash between Barcelona and Paris Saint Germain.</p>
