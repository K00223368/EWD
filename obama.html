<p>It’s been over two months since the end of Barack Obama’s presidency, but it looks like in that time, the former commander-in-chief has found it a bit challenging to adjust to civilian life. Earlier today Barack Obama was kicked off of a White House tour shouting, “I already know that!” after everything the tour guide said.Yikes! It looks like this former president has become something of a public nuisance.</p>

<p>Obama’s disruptions began only seconds into the tour, when the guide announced that they were standing in the East Wing of the White House and Obama screamed, “Obviously! I knew that already!” When the tour guide attempted to start speaking again, Obama interrupted her another time by yelling, “I know exactly where we are! It’s simple for me to get around in here!”</p>
<p>Members of the tour group said that Obama continued to shout, “I know that already,” at the guide until security forcibly removed him from the White House premises 45 minutes later. From facts about the White House’s history to the function of different rooms, Obama audibly declared that he already knew about everything, including when the tour guide informed him his loud outbursts were infringing on White House tour policy.
“The shouting completely ruined the tour,” said Marna Robins, a nurse from New York who was on the tour with President Obama. “Every time the tour guide gave us some fact about the White House, he would just belt out stuff like, ‘That’s not new to me!’
